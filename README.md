# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Statistical-Modeling
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical hypothesis testing on energy consumption data collected from telecom network sites. The goal is to identify consumption patterns, validate statistical assumptions, and make actionable recommendations to reduce energy costs.
The analysis covers:

Data cleaning and transformation

Time-based feature engineering

Statistical hypothesis testing (ANOVA, correlation)

Threshold recommendation for shutting down low-usage cells

Estimated savings in kWh and EGP based on tariff variations

ðŸ“Š Key Objectives
Determine if region significantly affects energy consumption

Investigate if there's a relationship between time of day and energy use

Calculate energy and cost savings by identifying under-utilized network cells

ðŸ§  Tools & Techniques
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels)

Statistical tests (ANOVA, correlation analysis)

Time series analysis

Cost calculations using dynamic tariff rates

ðŸ“‚ Data Sources
Energy Consumption.csv: Contains timestamps, site and cell IDs, region, and kWh readings.

Power Demand.csv: Contains national energy demand data in half-hour intervals.

Tariff price table for high, normal, and low-demand hours.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
Built time-based features (hour of day, peak periods)

Performed ANOVA and correlation tests to validate business hypotheses

Proposed a shutdown threshold and quantified the energy savings

Delivered insights using clean visualizations and narrative summaries
